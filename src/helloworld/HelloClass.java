/*
 * Other notes:
 * 
 * Information hiding: at the programming language level, Java has public, private, and protected.
 * 
 * Abstraction: As a process, denotes the extracting of the essential details 
 *     about an item/group of items, while ignoring the inessential details. 
 *     As an entity, denotes a model/other representation for an actual item. 
 *     Easily seen at Design Level:
 *  --- reduce complexity and focus on necessary properties of objects
 * Encapsulation: As a process, encapsulation means the act of enclosing one/more
 *     items within a container. As an entity, refers to a package or a box that 
 *     holds one/more items. Eg: arrays, functions,... As the box can be opaque, 
 *     some information can also be hidden at Implementation Level in order to:
 *  --- ensure simplicity, users don't need to care about implementation details, 
 *          as if just need carry the box while everything is enclosed inside
 *  --- hide important information from irrelevant users -> security.
 * 
 * Note: ignore and hiding are not identical
 * 
 * When use getter & setter:
 *  --- allow access to some useful information
 *  --- flexibility, trigger
 * When not use:
 *  --- if the information is sensitive
